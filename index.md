# EloMath Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 18, 2026**

## 1. Overview

EloMath ("we," "our," or "the App") is a competitive math education game. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.

We do not display advertisements in the App. We do not sell personal information to third parties. We do not permit any third-party or behavioral advertising within the App.

## 2. User Types

We maintain the following types of user accounts:

- **Individual Users:** Users aged 13 or older who create an account through Google sign-in.
- **School Administrators and Educators:** Teachers, administrators, or other school officials who create and manage tournaments or classrooms on behalf of their institution.
- **Tournament Participants:** Students who access the App through a school-administered tournament. Tournament Participants may be under the age of 13 where the administering school has provided consent as described in Section 8.

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Account Information

When you sign in with Google, we receive:

- Email address
- Google display name
- Google account identifier

You also create a username within the App.

### 3.2 Performance Data

As users play, we collect information about their gameplay, which we refer to as "Performance Data." This includes:

- Math questions encountered, categorized by subject and difficulty
- Number of questions answered correctly and incorrectly per subject
- Elo rating and rating history
- Time spent in matches
- Match results and opponent history

### 3.3 Game Progress Data

We store data related to in-app progression, including:

- Virtual currency balances (tickets and gold)
- Creature collection and inventory
- Shop transaction history (virtual currency only; no real-money transactions occur in the App)

### 3.4 Social and Competitive Data

If you use social features, we collect:

- Friends list connections
- Leaderboard rankings
- Tournament participation, scores, and results

### 3.5 Automatically Collected Technical Data

Our third-party service providers (Firebase Authentication and Supabase) automatically collect limited technical data as part of processing authentication requests and database queries. This may include:

- IP address (from which approximate location may be inferred)
- Device type and operating system version
- App version

We do not operate our own analytics, crash reporting, or telemetry services beyond what these providers collect in the course of delivering their services.

### 3.6 Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect biometric data, precise geolocation, health data, financial or payment information, contacts or address book data, microphone or camera data, or any data from device sensors.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use information we collect to:

- Operate and maintain your account
- Track gameplay progress, ratings, and achievements
- Provide Performance Data reports to School Administrators for Tournament Participants linked to their tournaments
- Enable social features including friends lists and leaderboards
- Facilitate tournaments and competitive events
- Improve the App's content, features, and user experience
- Compile aggregated, de-identified analytics (see Section 5)
- Protect the security of the App and enforce our Terms of Service

## 5. Aggregated and De-Identified Data

We may compile Performance Data into aggregated, de-identified statistics, such as accuracy rates across math subjects, common areas of difficulty, and performance trends by region or grade level.

**De-identification standard:** We consider data to be de-identified when all personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured such that the remaining information cannot reasonably identify a specific individual, consistent with the de-identification standards under FERPA (34 CFR § 99.31(b)). We do not report aggregated statistics for groups smaller than 10 users. We will not attempt to re-identify any data that has been de-identified.

We may share aggregated, de-identified data with educational institutions, researchers, and partners to support math education research and improvement. Because this data contains no personally identifiable information, it is not subject to the restrictions that apply to personal data under applicable privacy laws.

## 6. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

- **Google (Firebase Authentication):** Processes Google sign-in requests. Subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Supabase:** Hosts our database and backend services. Data is stored in Supabase's cloud infrastructure. Subject to [Supabase's Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

We share personal information with these providers only as necessary to operate the App. We do not share personal information with any other third parties except as required by law.

## 7. Age Requirements and Children's Privacy

### 7.1 Individual Users

EloMath requires Individual Users to be 13 years of age or older. During account creation, users provide their date of birth. Users who do not meet the age requirement are not permitted to create an account.

### 7.2 Children Under 13

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 except through the school-administered tournament pathway described in Section 8. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without appropriate consent, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us at the address in Section 14.

## 8. Educational Institution and Tournament Use

### 8.1 School Administrator Consent

Schools and educational organizations may register to host tournaments through EloMath. When a School Administrator creates a tournament, they agree to our Terms of Service, which include:

- Representing and warranting that the school has the authority to provide consent and authorization for EloMath to collect and use information from students under 13 before allowing such students to access the service
- Acknowledging that student personal information is collected for the use and benefit of the school's educational purposes
- Confirming that the school has authority to consent on behalf of parents for the collection of student data in an educational context, as permitted under COPPA

### 8.2 Data Visibility

School Administrators and Educators have access to Performance Data for Tournament Participants linked to their tournaments or classrooms. This includes individual per-student subject performance, scores, question-level accuracy, and participation records, for the purpose of monitoring student progress and informing instruction. School Administrators and Educators may not access data from other tournaments or Individual Users not associated with their institution.

### 8.3 Relationship to FERPA

When providing services to schools, we act as a "school official" with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). We use student education records solely to provide the tournament services requested by the school. We do not use student education records for any other purpose.

### 8.4 Student Data Ownership

Schools and students retain ownership of all Student Data. EloMath processes Student Data solely to provide the tournament services requested by the school. We do not use Student Data to send marketing communications to students, and we do not send promotional materials to student or child users.

### 8.5 AI and Machine Learning

We do not use Student Data to train artificial intelligence or machine learning models. We do not use algorithms to profile, target, or make automated decisions about individual students beyond the core gameplay functionality (such as Elo rating calculations and subject-level performance tracking).

### 8.6 School Review and Deletion Rights

Upon request, we will provide a School Administrator the opportunity to review all personal information collected from their students through the tournament services. Schools may request bulk deletion of all student data associated with their institution. We will fulfill such requests within 30 days.

A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is available upon request for schools and districts that require a formal agreement. Contact us at the email address in Section 14.

### 8.7 Data Processing Role

When providing services through school-administered tournaments, the school is the data controller and EloMath acts as a data processor. We process student data only as directed by the school and in accordance with our agreement with the school.

## 9. Data Security

We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including encrypted connections (TLS), access controls, and secure authentication. Our data is hosted by Supabase, which maintains its own security certifications and practices.

No method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify affected users and, where applicable, relevant authorities, within the timeframes required by applicable law.

## 10. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain personal data for as long as your account is active.

**Account deletion:** You may delete your account at any time by contacting us at the email address in Section 14. Upon receiving a deletion request, we will delete your personal information within 30 days, except where retention is required by applicable law. For Tournament Participants, deletion of an account removes the association between the user and their Performance Data; previously generated aggregated statistics are not affected.

**Aggregated data:** De-identified, aggregated data that cannot identify any individual may be retained indefinitely.

**Inactive accounts:** Accounts that have been inactive for more than 24 months may be flagged for deletion. We will notify you by email before deleting an inactive account.

## 11. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- **Access** the personal information we hold about you
- **Correct** inaccurate information
- **Delete** your account and associated data
- **Export** your data in a portable format
- **Withdraw consent** for data processing where consent is the legal basis
- **Object** to certain types of processing

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at the email address in Section 14. We will respond within the timeframe required by applicable law (generally 30 to 45 days depending on jurisdiction).

### 11.1 For California Residents (CCPA)

You have the right to know what personal information we collect and how it is used, to request deletion of your personal information, and to not be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights. We do not sell personal information as defined by the CCPA.

### 11.2 For European Residents (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for processing your data is your consent (provided at sign-in) and our legitimate interest in operating and improving the App. Your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where our service providers operate. You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

### 11.3 For Parents and Guardians

If your child has created an account without meeting the age requirements, or if your child participates in a school tournament and you wish to review, correct, or delete their information, please contact either the School Administrator or us directly. We will cooperate with schools to fulfill parental requests in accordance with COPPA and FERPA.

## 12. Data Transfer

Your information is processed and stored in the United States through our service provider Supabase. If you access the App from outside the United States, your information will be transferred to, and processed in, the United States, which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by email at least 14 days before the changes take effect. If you do not agree with the updated policy, you may delete your account before the changes take effect. Continued use of the App after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 14. Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, wish to exercise your data rights, or believe we have collected information from a child without appropriate consent, please contact us at:
